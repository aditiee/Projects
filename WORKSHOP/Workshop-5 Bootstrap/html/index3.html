                                            Frank was born Annelies or Anneliese Marie Frank on 12 June 1929 at the Maingau Red
                                            Cross Clinic in Frankfurt, Germany, to Edith (née Holländer) and Otto Heinrich

                                            Born a German national, she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless.

                                            For her thirteenth birthday on 12 June 1942, Frank received an autograph book, bound
                                            with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front.</li>

                                            As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, the Franks went
                                            into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's
                                            father, Otto Frank, worked.
                                            In March 1944, she heard a radio broadcast by Gerrit Bolkestein—a member of the
                                            Dutch government in exile, based in London—who said that when the war ended, he
                                            would create a public record of the Dutch people's oppression under German
                                            occupation.</li>
